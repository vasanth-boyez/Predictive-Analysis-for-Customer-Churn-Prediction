# 📊 Predictive Analysis for Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** repository!  
This project is a complete end-to-end **predictive analytics pipeline** that leverages machine learning to identify customers who are at risk of leaving a service or product.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

🔍 **Objective**: Predict whether a customer is likely to churn using historical behavioral and demographic data.

📈 **Why It Matters**: Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and reduce attrition.

🧠 **Modeling Approach**: Supervised learning using classification algorithms, combined with powerful visualizations and explainability.
