# 📊 Predictive Analysis for Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** repository!  
This project implements a complete predictive analytics pipeline that leverages **machine learning and deep learning techniques** to forecast customer churn. The standout feature of this project is a **hybrid deep learning model** combining CNN, LSTM, and Reinforcement Learning for robust churn prediction — trained on **synthetic customer data**.

## 🌟 Highlights: Hybrid Deep Learning Model (🔥 Core Feature)

🚀 This project features a **custom hybrid model** designed for enhanced pattern recognition and temporal analysis in customer data:

### 🔗 Model Architecture: **CNN + LSTM + Reinforcement Learning**

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| 🧠 **CNN** | Captures spatial dependencies and local patterns in structured input features. |
| 🔁 **LSTM** | Learns sequential and temporal customer behavior over time. |
| 🎯 **Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)** | Optimizes decisions for churn retention strategies based on state-action-reward logic. |

✨ This hybrid approach is tailored to uncover both **static and dynamic patterns** that drive customer churn, offering better accuracy and interpretability than traditional models.

## 🧪 Synthetic Data

📂 The project uses **synthetically generated customer data** to simulate various real-world churn patterns.

- Generated using domain-informed randomization techniques
- Mimics attributes like customer tenure, usage, complaints, support tickets, demographics
- Enables safe model experimentation without privacy concerns
